<h1>
    App Name Expiry
</h1>
</br><p>因为同事今天要做IAP的相关功能，他登录iTunesConnect，发现我们的那个App不见了！！</p>

<p>然后我们看了一下其他App，根本找不到有删除的按钮，所以感觉这应该是Apple删除的。</p>

<p>然后我网上查了一下，找到了这个：</p>

<p>
After creating your app and it is in the state Prepare For Upload or Waiting For Upload, you have 180 days (6 months) from your creation date in iTunes Connect to deliver a binary to Apple. If you do not deliver a binary before the 180-day deadline, your app is deleted from iTunes Connect. As a result of this deletion, your app name can be used by another developer and you cannot reuse the app name, SKU or bundle ID. See “Deleting an App” to learn more about the ramifications of App Delete.

<p>
All admin and technical iTunes Connect users for your account receive the following email warnings to remind you of apps that are approaching their App Name Expiration date:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>150 Day Warning. You will receive an email when you have had an app created for
150 days but have not yet delivered a binary, reminding you that you have 30 more days to deliver your binary or your app will be deleted from iTunes Connect. You will be given an exact date of your deadline in this email.</p></li>
<li><p>173 Day Warning. You will receive an email when you have had an app created for 173 days but have not yet delivered a binary, reminding you that you have 7 more days to deliver your binary or your app will be deleted from iTunes Connect. You will be given an exact date of your deadline in this email.</p></li>
<li><p>180 Day Deletion Confirmation. You will receive an email confirming that your app has been deleted from iTunes Connect, if you have not delivered a binary before your 180-day deadline.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>因为那个开发者帐号是公司的Purchase管的，我感慨人家都发了3封信提醒了，竟然都被他忽视了。</p>

<p>不过通过这件事，也让我知道了，<b>如果你迟迟不提交，你的App是会被Apple从iTunesConnect上面删除的。</b></p>
